# Reflections Log

This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.

### Mathematical Verification:

While reviewing the mathematical formulas for volume and surface area for each of the 3D shapes, the formulas seemed to match up with the provided mathematical formulas in the README.md. While reviewing the added Cone class mathematical formulas, I noticed that the volume formula matched up with the resource used but the surface area formula was a bit different. I took the given formula from the AI and looked it up, and it does seem to be a working formula for the surface area of a cone.

- Test calculations with known values (use online calculators for verification)

- Document your verification process in your reflection (in REFLECTION.md)

### Code Quality Review
While checking for proper naming conventions I found that: The class and interface names are using PascalCase. The instance fields are using camelCase. The method names are using camelCase. The code style seems fairly consistent across the classes.

### AI Output Analysis

- Compare outputs from different AI tools.

Manual Modifications (Driver Class):
* Former Line 72, accepted suggestion to import class highlighted by "Shape3D:" private static final List<Shape3D> shapes = new ArrayList<>();
* - I wanted to see if accepting the suggestion would help get rid of the errors.

* - Former line 206, accepted suggestion to import class highlighted by "Sphere" yield new Sphere(name, color, r);
* It seemed to help with the last error, so I also imported this.

* - I also imported the classes for the rest of the shapes.
* This seemed to get rid of the rest of the red compiling errors.

### Reflection Questions
* AI Effectiveness: Where did AI tools excel? Where did they struggle?

AI tools did well giving breakdowns about different things. I think it was decently thorough in explaining things and if I had questions it did a pretty good job giving explanations that made sense. The biggest issue I had was needing to import some things in order for the code to compile properly, but I didn't have too many issues with the generated code so far.
* Code Quality Comparison: How does AI-generated code compare to manual coding?

AI generated code is definitely a lot easier and faster than manual coding. The AI did a lot of the heavy work that would've taken a lot longer to type out. However, there is a possibility of it being harder to catch mistakes in code because you would have to go through an entire thing of code compared to if you manually code and consistently check for things as you code. The code generated by AI is also a lot more complicated than what a beginner coder would code manually.
* Learning Experience: What did you learn about inheritance AND AI-assisted development?

I learned that AI assisted coding focuses on more on reviewing and testing compared to manually coding which also involves problem-solving skills and coming up with ideas of code to create and implement. Though AI assisted development also does require problem-solving for mistakes made by the AI and compile errors. Of course manual coding requires reviewing and testing, but with AI assisted development you sort of skip to that part. AI assisted development also requires you to be good at creating a prompt in order to fulfill your request properly. This project used inheritance in order to declare method signatures without implementation for each of the shapes. That way we can define different things like volume and surface area without needing to specify what shape it is.
* Validation Process: How did you ensure the AI-generated code was correct?

To ensure that the AI code was correct I some testing, checking, and comparing information. I also asked the AI questions about the code it generated and asked it to review things and explain things to me in order to help me validate it.
* Future Applications: How will you use AI tools in future programming projects?

I think AI tools can be really useful to ask questions and help understand certain code. For example if you get stuck on something and are not too sure how to fix the problem you could see if AI can help come up with possible solutions. You can also use it to explain things so they make more sense.
