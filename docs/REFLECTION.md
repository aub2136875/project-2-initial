This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.

**Mathematical Verification:**
While reviewing the mathematical formulas for volume and surface area for each of the 3D shapes, the formulas seemed to match up with the provided mathematical formulas in the README.md. While reviewing the added Cone class mathematical formulas, I noticed that the volume formula matched up with the resource used but the surface area formula was a bit different. I took the given formula from the AI and looked it up, and it does seem to be a working formula for the surface area of a cone.

While testing values for
